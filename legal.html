          <h1 class="h3 wider">Disclaimer – legal notice</h1>
          <h1 class="h5 top">Right of information and cancellation</h1>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">You have the right to inquire about the data collected about you free of charge and without delay at any time. You can also revoke your consent to the use of your personal data with effect for the future. To do so, please contact the service provider indicated in the imprint.</p>
          <h1 class="h5">Data Protection (general)</h1>
          <p class="p-impressum">When you access our website, general information (so-called server log files) is automatically collected. This includes the web browser you use, your operating system and your internet service provider. This data does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person and is statistically evaluated by us in order to improve our website technically and in terms of content. The collection of this information is necessary in order to be able to deliver the content of the website correctly.</p>
          <p class="p-impressum">The use of the website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.</p>
          <p class="p-impressum">If a contractual relationship is to be established, the content of which is to be developed or changed, or if you submit an inquiry to us, we collect and use personal data from you insofar as this is necessary for this purpose (inventory data). We collect, process and use personal data to the extent necessary to enable you to use the website (usage data). All personal data is only stored for as long as is necessary for the stated purpose (processing your inquiry or handling a contract). In doing so, we take into account retention periods under tax and commercial law. By order of the competent authorities, we must provide information about this data (inventory data) in individual cases, insofar as this is necessary for the purposes of criminal prosecution, to avert danger, to fulfill the statutory tasks of the constitution protection authorities or the Military Counter-Intelligence Service or to enforce intellectual property rights.</p>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">We expressly point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Access to data cannot be completely protected.</p>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited. This does not apply to existing business relationships or if we have given our consent to do so.</p>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">The providers and all third parties mentioned on this website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information. The same applies to the commercial use and forwarding of data.</p>
          <h1 class="h3 wider">Disclaimer (exclusion of liability)</h1>
          <h1 class="h5 top">1. Liability for contents<br></h1>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general legislation pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of corresponding infringements, we will remove this content immediately.</p>
          <h1 class="h5">2. Liability for links<br></h1>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">This website contains links to external websites of third parties, the content of which cannot be influenced. Therefore, no liability can be assumed for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will immediately remove such links from this website to the infringing site.</p>
          <h1 class="h5">3. Copyright<br></h1>
          <p class="p-impressum last-p">The contents and works on these pages created by the service providers, their employees and commissioned third parties are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the prior written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, such content will be removed immediately.</p>
